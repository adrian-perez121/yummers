## Initial Thoughts

This is going to be one of the bigger projects that I work on while using rails. I have done so much
reading to know hopefully run into as few wrinkles as possible but I know no matter what They will happen.
Anyways the main idea of this app to be a social media website but more food themed. I want to also
add a chat feature within the app which I know will take much more reading and practice with websockets.
Welp let's get this ideas out of my head and into code...
